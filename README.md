# 8D Autonomy UI

A cinematic, narrative-driven React.js interface designed to showcase
the autonomous intelligence stack of 8-D.AI.

This project focuses on immersive storytelling, smooth transitions,
and a premium futuristic aesthetic rather than a traditional product grid.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

The interface is designed as a **scroll-based narrative**:
- Users are guided through vision, autonomy, and intelligence layers
- Smooth fades, parallax grids, and glow effects create depth
- Minimal UI elements keep focus on core technology

The goal was to make complex autonomous systems feel **approachable,
high-end, and future-forward**.
