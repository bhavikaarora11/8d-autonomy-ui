# 8D Autonomy UI

A cinematic, narrative-driven **React.js** interface designed to showcase  
the autonomous intelligence stack of **8-D.AI**.

This project focuses on immersive storytelling, smooth transitions,  
and a premium futuristic aesthetic rather than a traditional product grid.

 Design Philosophy

The interface is designed as a **scroll-based narrative experience**:

- Users are guided through vision, autonomy, and intelligence layers
- Smooth fades, parallax grids, and glow effects create visual depth
- Minimal UI elements keep focus on core autonomous technology

The goal was to make complex AI and autonomy systems feel  
**approachable, high-end, and future-forward**.
